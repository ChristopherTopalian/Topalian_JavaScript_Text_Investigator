// HowToCombineJSFilesUsingBatFile.js

We can combine all of the .js files
that are located in our js folder
into one main.js file, using either:
    The Command Prompt Method
    or
    The .bat File Method

The .bat file method is very easy.
We double click the bat file, which is located in our js folder, and it will make a main.js file, which includes all .js files in the js folder, including all .js files in all subdirectories of our js folder.

This is a very easy way to combine our .js files, because we can double click the .bat file anytime, and it will again generate the main.js file, which includes all .js files in the js folder, including all .js files in all subdirectories of our js folder. This makes uploading our application online much easier.

Happy Scripting :-)
